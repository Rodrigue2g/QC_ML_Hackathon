  abstract = {One potential benefit of using a public cloud, such as Amazon EC2, is that a cloud could be more efficient. In theory, a cloud can support many users, and it can potentially achieve a much higher server utilization through aggregating a large number of demands. But is it really the case in practice?  If you ask a cloud provider, they most likely would not tell you their CPU utilization. But this is a really good information to know. Besides settling the argument whether cloud is more efficient, it is very interesting from a research angle because it points out how much room we have in terms of improving server utilization.},
